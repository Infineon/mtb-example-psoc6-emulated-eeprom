# PSoC 6 MCU: Emulated EEPROM

This example uses the Arm® Cortex®-M4 (CM4) CPU of PSoC™ 6 MCU to execute two tasks: UART communication and emulate EEPROM behavior in flash memory. At device reset, the default Cortex-M0+ (CM0+) application enables the CM4 CPU and configures the CM0+ CPU to go to sleep. In this example, a counter is read from the emulated EEPROM (Em_EEPROM), incremented, written back to Em_EEPROM, and printed over the UART. This occurs at every device reset or power cycle. As a result, the UART prints out an incrementing value at every reset.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In Command-line Interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool to easily create one or more ModusToolbox applications. See the "Project Creator Tools" section of the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) for more details.

Alternatively, you can manually create the application using the following steps:

1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.

2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder.

   On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, open the **modus-shell** app from the Start menu.

   **Note:** The cloned application contains a default BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.mtb*) in the *deps* folder. Use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) (`make modlibs` command) to select and download a different BSP file, if required. If the selected kit does not have the required resources or is not [supported](#supported-kits-make-variable-target), the application may not work.

3. Import the required libraries by executing the `make getlibs` command.

Various CLI tools include a `-h` option that prints help information to the terminal screen about that tool. For more details, see the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

1. Follow the instructions from the **In Command-line Interface (CLI)** section to create the application, and import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*.

3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

</details>

## Operation

If using a PSoC 64 'Secure' MCU kit (like CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W), the PSoC 64 MCU must be provisioned with keys and policies before being programmed. Follow the instructions in the ['Secure Boot' SDK User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/software-and-drivers/psoc-64-secure-mcu-secure-boot-sdk-user-guide) to provision the device. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder.

In this example, EEPROM storage can be declared in either the application flash (user flash) or in the section of the flash dedicated for Em_EEPROM. The example uses the dedicated Em_EEPROM region of the flash for emulation by default. If you are using the user flash area for EEPROM emulation for PSoC 64 MCU, see the [Placing the EEPROM Array in User Flash for CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W](#placing-the-eeprom-array-in-user-flash-for-cy8ckit-064b0s2-4343w) section before programming.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
      </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
</details>

4. After programming the device, observe the counter value in the serial terminal. The value increments each time you reset or cycle power. The figure below shows a sample output.

**Figure 1. Sample Output Showing Incremental Counter Value**

![](./images/terminal_output.png)

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Design and Implementation

This example demonstrates how to use Em_EEPROM middleware. The application also uses a Serial Communication Block (SCB) resource, configured as UART.

On startup, the example initializes the SCB and the Em_EEPROM block in flash. Then, a read operation is performed to verify whether the data stored in EEPROM is valid. If valid, the counter is incremented by one and the new value of the counter is written back to the Em_EEPROM. Otherwise, the expected valid data is written to the Em_EEPROM. The firmware then reads the value in the Em_EEPROM and prints it to a terminal window via UART. Every time the device is reset or power is cycled, the counter is incremented and printed on serial terminal.

The firmware includes the declaration of EEPROM storage and details of the EEPROM configuration and context structures. In this example, EEPROM storage can be declared in either the application flash (user flash) or in the section of the flash dedicated for Em_EEPROM. If the data is written to the user flash, a blocking write must be used. This is because a write to and read/execute from the same flash sector at the same time while using non-blocking writes may cause a HardFault exception. Either blocking or non-blocking write will work for the Em_EEPROM flash, because it is in a different flash sector. For more details, see [Flash System Routine (Flash)](https://cypresssemiconductorco.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/group__group__flash.html) section in PDL documentation.

The example can choose either user flash or dedicated EEPROM area in the flash for EEPROM emulation. Set the `FLASH_REGION_TO_USE` macro as `USER_FLASH` or `EMULATED_EEPROM_FLASH` to store in the user flash or EEPROM area respectively. The example uses the dedicated EEPROM area of the flash for EEPROM emulation by default.

See the [API Reference Quick Start Guide](https://cypresssemiconductorco.github.io/emeeprom/em_eeprom_api_reference_manual/html/index.html#section_em_eeprom_quick_start) section for step-by-step instruction on how to enable the Emulated EEPROM Middleware Library.

### Placing the EEPROM Array in User Flash for CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W

In the case of CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W, post-build steps are executed which perform signing of the image as dictated by the policies provided by the user. Because the counter value in the EEPROM is incremented at every reset/power-cycle, a signature mismatch would occur if the EEPROM is within the image area (user flash area) that gets signed.

Therefore, in order to prevent a signature mismatch, this example is configured to emulate the EEPROM at a fixed location outside the image area in the user flash as specified by the `APP_DEFINED_EM_EEPROM_LOCATION_IN_FLASH` macro. The EEPROM is placed at the end of the image area. This requires the size of the CM4 image to be modified in the policy.

To do this, open the default policy, *policy/policy_single_CM0_CM4*, in an editor and go to the CM4 application image boot and upgrade policy. For CM4 application image, the JSON field `id` is set as 16. Next, in the resources section, change the value of the size such that `address + size = APP_DEFINED_EM_EEPROM_LOCATION_IN_FLASH`. 

**Note:** Refer to the <BSP>.mk (e.g. CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W.mk) file in the BSP to know  the default policy name. The Make variable `CY_SECURE_POLICY_NAME` denotes the default policy name. Please note that the default policy must be *policy/policy_single_CM0_CM4* while using cysecuretools version 2.0.0 and it must be *policy/policy_single_CM0_CM4_swap* while using cysecuretools version 3.0.0. You can find the version of the tool by entering `cysecuretools version` in **modus-shell**. ModusToolbox 2.2 bundles cysecuretools version 2.0.0 in the installation package. You can install cysecuretools version 3.0.0 by running the following command in **modus-shell**.

   `python -m pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall cysecuretools`
